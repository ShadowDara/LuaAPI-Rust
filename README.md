# Daras Lua API

a Lua API written in Rust to make scripting much easier!

> [!TIP]
> You this for scripting prevent the need install one extra library for every new script you want to make

Run a script with
```sh
luajit <your-script.lua>
```

to suppress file and os access ad `-safe` at the end

Read the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) or the Docs for more Infos

**Feel free to open an Issue for a build request or feature request!**

> [!CAUTION]
> The Program is **NOT** guaranteed stable before **1.0.0**

## Running
For Infos or help run:
```sh
luajit --help
```

## Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Building, installing, and using the workflow on **Linux** (especially ARM64/aarch64) and **macOS** may currently require manual setup or additional dependencies.  
> If you're running into issues, you're **not alone** â€” improvements are planned, but help is **HIGHLY** appreciated.
